    "The wrangling process started by the collection of the three different files in relation with the Twitter user WeRateDogs.\n",

    "We then started the analysis process to identify correction we should apply. As stated in the project guideline, many steps could have been performed. But we concentrated our wrangling efforts to the mandatory issues to address being 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues. \n",

    "The identification of issues was done for each file separately and the outcome were as follow:\n",

    "- Some numerators were wrongly extracted\n",

    "All files were duplicated for the cleaning process. The files use for the operation were called as follow: **file_wr**\n",
